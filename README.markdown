The ShowClix API
================

This is the ShowClix API Client Library intended to facilitate access to the
ShowClix RESTful API.  Documentation can be found at the [ShowClix Developer Site](http://developer.showclix.com).

For private access, you must contact ShowClix to be setup with a Partner Account
and have your CSR signed.  Certain data is provided to the public (e.g. basic
event and venue information) and does not require authentication.  See the
[ShowClix Developer Site](http://developer.showclix.com) for more.
